# A Chrome extension to automate content downloads

After finishing the script, a ".html" file is generated in which it is possible to print in PDF

In the PDF version, as it does not scroll automatically, I suggest pressing the scroll button and moving the mouse down slightly, or pressing the "Page Down" button to speed up the process.

It is very important to go to the end of the .html file page to be able to print everything in files with many pages
ePUB files can be translated into your language in the .html file

*I'm not responsible for anything, feel free to get this code and use it as you see fit, I don't guarantee it will work, there probably won't be any updates as I'm in the 7-day free period, I made this script just for fun.*

# *Read the description of each format to avoid browser crashes*
