# An active account is required.

-  **To install this extension in chrome please follow the steps indicated [here](https://dev.to/ben/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually-from-github-1612).**

After finishing the script, a ".html" file is generated in which it is possible to print in PDF

In the PDF version, as it does not scroll automatically, I suggest pressing the scroll button and moving the mouse down slightly, or pressing the "Page Down" button to speed up the process.

It is very important to go to the end of the page of the saved .html file if you are going to print PDF, as very large files will not load completely until they reach the end of the page. ePUB books can be translated into other languages directly in the .html file

If the file is so large that the browser cannot process it, you can edit the .html and cut it into parts to split the process, or use another browser to open the .html, I recommend Firefox which uses less memory.

> # New function to continue where you left off:
Now you can reload the page if it's stuck, then just click again to start and continue where you left off, and just below there is a button to reset this continuity if necessary.

> # To use offline:
It is very important to convert the .html to PDF otherwise it will not be possible to use it offline and also the images have an expiration date, so it is necessary to convert to PDF, if you don't know how to do this, just press "Ctrl + P" with the open .html file and select "Save as PDF"

# *Read the description of each format to avoid browser crashes*

*After accessing the book normally via: `https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/(ID*)` you can start the automation.*

>*There are no guarantees of functionality, feel free to take this code and use it as you see fit, there will probably be no updates as I am in the 7 day free period, some books may have specific bugs because I didn't have time to test all the possibilities.*
