# A Chrome extension to automate content downloads

After finishing the script, a ".html" file is generated in which it is possible to print in PDF

In the PDF version, as it does not scroll automatically, I suggest pressing the scroll button and moving the mouse down slightly, or pressing the "Page Down" button to speed up the process.

It is very important to go to the end of the page of the saved .html file if you are going to print PDF, as very large files will not load completely until they reach the end of the page. ePUB books can be translated into other languages directly in the .html file

*I'm not responsible for anything, feel free to take this code and use it as you see fit, I don't guarantee it will work, there will probably be no updates as I'm in the 7-day free period, I made this script just for fun, some books may have specific bugs because I didn't have time to test all the possibilities.*

# *Read the description of each format to avoid browser crashes*
