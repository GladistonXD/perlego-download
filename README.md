After finishing the script, a ".html" file is generated in which it is possible to print in PDF

In the PDF version, as it does not scroll automatically, I suggest pressing the scroll button and moving the mouse down slightly, or pressing the "Page Down" button to speed up the process.

It is very important to go to the end of the page of the saved .html file if you are going to print PDF, as very large files will not load completely until they reach the end of the page. ePUB books can be translated into other languages directly in the .html file

If you get lost in the pages of the manual PDF format, or there is a connection error that makes it impossible to continue, you can use the `Table of contents` to guide you, however, before opening the contents it is very important not to leave it on the `/0` page because the site has a bug that says that PDF does not exist on page '0' so the tab will freeze, I advise you to reload the page directly at `/3`, this bug only happens in PDF format.

If the file is so large that the browser cannot process it, you can edit the .html and cut it into parts to divide the process.

*I'm not responsible for anything, feel free to take this code and use it as you see fit, I don't guarantee it will work, there will probably be no updates as I'm in the 7-day free period, I made this script just for fun, some books may have specific bugs because I didn't have time to test all the possibilities.*

# *Read the description of each format to avoid browser crashes*

*After accessing the book normally via: `https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/(ID*)` you can start the automation.*
